# Arduino-Clock
I've decided to get into IOT again, and my first off-book endeavor has been to create a simple clock using the RTC DS3231 module and 7 segment display. Since I couldn't find a way similar to this online, I decided to create this repo to show how I did it

Image uses a 16 pin segment for the display, but I used a 12 pin display. Disregard the outer 4 pins on the image (sorry it's a little messy, there's a lot going on)
